##### Discussion Part

1. **How About Your School Story?**
   - Everyone has a collection of secrets unknown to others, and the past is so fascinating. How about your campus stories? In each stage of the past, whether it's junior high school, high school, or university, what can you still recall? If you can only be allowed share one thing about each phase, which one you will pick? Can you use a word and a paragraph to describe it, it can be a story, or a person, or just a certain scene? When you mentioned it again, do you still have the same feeling or mindset?

2. **What's the Difference Between Your Current Life and School Life?**
   - As we grow, our lives transform. How about your current life? what's the difference between yourr current life and scholl life? do you have any pets now? do you live alone or with someone? can you enjoy your current life more? Describe any aspect about the difference you can come up with.

3. **Do You Want to Go Back to School? Why?**
   - Here is a time machine. Do you want to go back to scholl? If not, why? Aren't you satisfied with the past scholl? what's your ideal school? If yes, when and where do you want to go back? what's the most attractive thing for you? even you're willing to give up everything in the real world.
