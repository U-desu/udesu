##### Topic Introduction
Human’s whole life is accompanied with choices. Some of them maybe the areas one never involved before; the others may just let you repeat one normal day over and over again, even though time is passing by indeed.
Sometimes, as I wake up in the morning, early or late, the days we called Repeat hurts me like thorn. What will it take if you wanna make some change?
Maybe a little bit courage. The courage to live along; The courage to recognize new fellows; The courage to share your vision...
What’s more important, when we facing the people who working on totally different industries, how should we start with a conversation? Any chance that we can search for cooperation? What if they are totally different racial, living totally different cultural, holding totally different belief?
